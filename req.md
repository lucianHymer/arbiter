Can you add linting and formatting to this repo with Biome um and get that you know up to stuff and then uh add like GitHub workflows and like pre-commit formatting and linting and um make sure our unit tests are good to go. And like looking good and make sure all that stuff isn't like a GitHub CI workflow.

Use Husky for the pre-commit and um for the CI is just on PR. Um the Husky should just be kinda you know doing like checking and then have like commands to actually fix stuff too. But like the user has to run those. Um and then I want you to like actually add like pretty good unit tests, like mock most things sort of fast, and then some integration tests where it makes sense if you think it makes sense anywhere. Maybe take a look

Be strict and get everything passing.
